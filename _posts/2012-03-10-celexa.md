Celexa, or citalopram, is a more recent name-brand SSRI used to treat depression, but has also recently been identified by the FDA in 2011 as being associated with very serious birth defects and other side effects. The Food and Drug Administration issued warnings to adults who taking high dosages of Celexa on a regular basis that the risk of deadly heart conditions including fatal heart rhythm problems is much greater than those at lower dosages. Consumer Reports has also released a report on the study as well.
