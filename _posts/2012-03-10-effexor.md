Effexor, or venlafaxine, is on the market today as an antidepressant and anti-anxiety medication that had been approved by the FDA and released in 2004 as another member of the SSRI classification. Since then it has been shown to have a positive correlation with permanent and serious birth defects including abdominal birth defects, anal atresia, cardiac defects, limb defects, cleft lip, cleft palate and genital defects.
