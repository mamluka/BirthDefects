Paxil, or paroxetine, has been one of the most widely prescribed medications for depression.  The drug Paxil is also associated with dangerous side effects in men and women of all ages.  It also is linked to very dangerous birth defects like heart defects, PPHN and ASD if taken by pregnant women. A study done in 2006 regarding SSRI side effects that was referenced by the FDA (Food and Drug Administrartion) has identified Paxil to be extremely dangerous for women who are pregnant or who can become pregnant.
