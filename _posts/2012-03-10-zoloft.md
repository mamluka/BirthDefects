Zoloft, or sertraline, is a popular antidepressant known as a "selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor" or SSRI.  Zoloft is linked to dangerous side effects and serious birth defects (including heart defects and lung diseases) if taken by women before and during pregnancy. Since 2006, the FDA has warned pregnant mothers against using Zoloft and other SSRI's. It is important that you contact your doctor and a birth defect lawyer if you feel that taking Zoloft has caused you side effects.
