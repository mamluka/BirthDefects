The National Injury Attorney Network is an attorney matching service offered for free to individuals within the United States that have suffered an injury at the fault of another.

The purpose of this service is to provide you the consumer with a free resource to share specific details about your legal case, help you understand whether or not you have a case based on the case requirements and your personal situation and to ultimately match you with the most competent attorney that services such cases.  Attorneys within the National Injury Attorney Network work on a contingency basis.

Legal case reviews cost you nothing and if no compensation is awarded, you pay no legal fees.  The National Injury Attorney Network works as a marketing company for attorneys and is not an attorney referral service.
